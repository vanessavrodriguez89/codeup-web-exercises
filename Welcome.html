    <h1>Welcome to Codeup, Hyperion!</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.</p>
    <p>It is the language that is used to structure web pages. </p>
    <p>HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to the user.</p>
    <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>
    These are called <em>element tags</em>. They inform the browser how to display the page.
    <p>They look like this: &lt;div&gt;</p>
    <p>They almost always come with a closing tag somewhere later that looks like this: &lt;/div&gt;</p>
    Whatever is between the opening tag and the closing tag is called an element. Let's create some...
    <div>In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in an &lt;h1&gt; tag.
        And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.</div>
